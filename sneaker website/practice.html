<body class="container-fluid">
        <div class="row">
                <!-- all columns must equal 12 ---->
                <div id="box1" class="col-lg-3">Mom, Dad. (he falls over) Marty, are you alright? Did you hurt your head? (Marty gets back up.) You guys look great. Mom, you look so thin.
                </div>
                <div id="box2" class="col-lg-3">Wait. Let's just think this thing through logically. We know it can't run on its own power, and we know we can't pull it. But, if we can figure out a way to push it up to 88 mph...huh? (Suddenly the train whistle blows outside. Doc turns and looks out the window and sees the train.) That's it! (Train Station) (Marty and Doc are standing next to the train talking to the conductor.)
                </div>
                <div id="box3" class="col-lg-3"> Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you? Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly. Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall? Um, yeah, I'm on my way. (Twin Pines Mall)
                </div>
                <div id="box4" class="col-lg-3">(The police car takes off and passes Marty and Doc.) Let's go, I sure hope we find Jennifer before she finds herself! (He looks at a sign which gives information on the skyway. It says "Skewed on Skyway C25".) Damn, the skyway's jammed, it's going to take us forever to get there. (Almanac) And this stays here, I didn't invent the time machine to win at gambling, I invented the time machine to travel through time! I know, I know Doc! (Doc puts the almanac on a barrel and the two leave. Unknown to them, Biff has been overhearing! He opens a door to see the almanac and picks it up.) So, Doc Brown invented a time machine.
                </div>
            
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-4 text-light bg-success" >Hey, it's him! And he's in disguise! Guys, what's that? (He points in the other direction, they turn and look, and he pushes past them like he did with Griff's gang in 2015. Marty runs off. The gang gets up.) 3-Come on, let's get him! </div> 
                <div class="col-md-4 text-light bg-info">(moves off) Well, I guess Miss Clayton will have to find other transportation. Turning to face Marty. If I never meet the woman, there's no possibility of a romantic infatuation, right? You're the doc, Doc. Alright then. Let's get the Delorean and get ourselves back to the future! (casually) Oh Doc, I tore a hole in the gas tank. We'll have to patch it up and get gas. (Freezes in place) You mean we're out of gas? </div>
                 <div class="col-md-4 text-light bg-danger">(Hill Valley) (Marty wanders around and spots another Election Van driving around.) Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas... (A man throws a newspaper away and Marty picks it up and sees the date as November 5th, 1955.) This has gotta be a dream.</div><!--end of row--->    
               <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6">(Den) If this thing works, it'll solve all your financial problems. And if it doesn't work Needles, I could get fired. It's illegal! I mean, what if the Jitz is watching, huh? The Jitz will never find out! Come on, stick your card in the slot and I'll handle it. Nah. (He starts to walk off)</div>

                <p>Of course they run. But for recreation, for fun. Run for fun? Ha-ha, what the hell kind of fun is that? (Another old man begins to laugh.) (Blacksmith Shop) (Marty arrives in town. He jumps off his horse and runs into Doc's shop.)Emmett! (Marty is keeping his eye on the speedometer and talking to himself.) Come on, come on. (He suddenly screams into the walkie-talkie.) You better hold on to something, Doc, the yellow log's about to blow!!! (There is a big explosion and Clara is shown, stunned, as she was thrown back a little on the car she was climbing on.) Ahh! Golly.</p>
               
               <br>
               
               <p>No, no, no, no, no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids! (The DeLorean) (Inside Marty and Jennifer are seated in the passenger seat while Doc is driving.) Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads.</p>
               
               <br>
               
               <p>(to George) Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? (George grabs his bike and rides off.) Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. (Bedroom) (Marty jerks awake. He's in a bed in a darkened room. He hears someone moving around.) Mom, is that you? There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now.</p>
               
               <br>

               <p>(Marty and Doc walk up to the school.) Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. This sounds pretty heavy. Weight has nothing to do with it.</p>
